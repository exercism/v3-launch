# Add prerequisites to practice exercises

Exercism V3 introduces a new type of exercise: [Concept Exercises](https://github.com/exercism/v3-docs/blob/master/product/concept-exercises.md). All existing (V2) exercises will become [Practice Exercises](https://github.com/exercism/v3-docs/blob/master/product/practice-exercises.md).

Concept Exercises and Practice Exercises are linked to each other via [Concepts](https://github.com/exercism/v3-docs/blob/master/anatomy/tracks/concepts.md). Concepts are taught by Concept Exercises and practiced in Practice Exercises. Each Exercise (Concept or Practice) has prerequisites, which must be met to unlock an Exercise -  once all the prerequisite Concepts have been "taught" by a Concept Exercise, the exercise itself becomes unlocked.

For example, in some languages completing the Concept Exercises that teach "String Interpolation"  and "Optional Parameters" might then unlock `two-fer`.


Each Practice Exercise should have one or more prerequisites, where each prerequisite describes the minimal set of concepts the Practice Exercise requires the student to be familiar with.

There doesn't have to be a Concept Exercise that unlocks each prerequisite, although ideally there should be. If a Concept is not unlocked by any Concept Exercise, we'll considered to be unlocked for the purpose of unlocking the Practice Exercise.
