# Add key features

In Exercism v3, each track can specify (at most) six key features. Students will use these features to determine whether or not they want to join a track, so the features should highlight the language's best and/or most interesting features.

Key features are specified in the top-level `"key_features"` field in the track's `config.json` file and are defined as an array of objects, as specified in [the spec](https://github.com/exercism/v3-docs/blob/master/anatomy/tracks/config-json.md#key-features).
