# Add key features

In Exercism v3, each track must specify exactly six "key features". Exercism uses these features to highlight the most interesting, unique or "best" features of a language to a student.

Key features are specified in the top-level `"key_features"` field in the track's `config.json` file and are defined as an array of objects, as specified in [the spec](https://github.com/exercism/v3-docs/blob/master/anatomy/tracks/config-json.md#key-features).
