# Add tags

In Exercism v3, tracks can be annotated with tags. This allows searching for tracks with a certain tag combination, making it easy for students to find an interesting track to join.

Tags are specified in the top-level `"tags"` field in the track's `config.json` file and are defined as an array of strings, as specified in [the spec](https://github.com/exercism/v3-docs/blob/master/anatomy/tracks/config-json.md#tags).

The `"tags"` field in the `config.json` file should be updated to contain the tags that are relevant to this track. The list of tags that can be used is listed in [the spec](https://github.com/exercism/v3-docs/blob/master/anatomy/tracks/config-json.md#tags).
