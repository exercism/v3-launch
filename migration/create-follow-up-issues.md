# Create follow-up issues

- [Configure online editor](./configure-online-editor.md)
- [Add key features](./add-key-features)
- [Add tags](./add-tags.md)
- [Add prerequisites to Practice Exercises](./add-prerequisites-to-practice-exercises.md)
- [Pass linting checks](./pass-linting-checks.md)
- [Build Test Runner](./build-test-runner.md)
- [Build Analyzer and Representer](./build-analyzer-and-representer.md) (optional)

We'll create one issue for the above checklist and add a comment that only the Exercism Team is allowed to check the boxes. And then we'll create separate issues for all of the the individual items in the above list.
